# FlatOMate

```Problem Statement```

~ We know that there is a lot of migration of students from all over nation to Mumbai as it provides with some of the best colleges in India. <br>
~ We know that there is lack of hostel facility in most of the Mumbai Colleges. <br>
~ Also it’s very difficult to find room as cost of living is very high as well as most of the student crowd is from Mumbai itself.<br>
~ Often we see that this crowd of migrating students face problems in finding right person to stay with. Also, there are very less chances of getting students as room mates. <br>
~ So to tackle all this problem we are building the app ‘FlatOMate’.
